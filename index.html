		<h2> Sneaker Collection</h2>
		<p>My love for sneakers started when I was young. My father from a young age always had me with the latest sneakers. Ever since then i've always felt a certain connection with fashion and sneakers is one of my favorite parts of it. I have about 50 pairs of sneakers and they are all great and I hold memories with them.</p>
